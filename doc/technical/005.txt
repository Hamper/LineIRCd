Numeric 005 Documentation (c) 2002 codemastr (Dominick Meglio) [codemastr@unrealircd.com]
(As of Unreal3.2-beta11)

Numeric 005 allows the server to inform the client of any protocol specific features in the
IRCd.  The numeric is sent at connection time immediately after numeric 004. Additionally
the numeric is sent when a /version request is made by a local user, for remote users
numeric 105 is used but contains the same information.

Due to the limit imposed by RFC1459 on both the buffer size (512) and the amount of
parameters that can be sent in a single command (15) a total of 13 parameters may be
specified in each 005. Because of this, a client must be able to accept multiple 005s
consecutively. The format for the 005 message is as follows:

":" <servername> "005" SPACE <nickname> SPACE <token[=value]> SPACE ... ":are supported
by this server"

Currently UnrealIRCd supports several tokens that are included in numeric 005. A list of
all tokens, their respective value and a brief description are listed below.
